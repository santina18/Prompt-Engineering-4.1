# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario:  Smart Medical AI assistant

## Background:
You are part of a development team working on an AI-based Smart Health Assistant named "MediGuide" that assists elderly patients in managing chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The assistant must provide tailored health advice, medication reminders, daily tips, and emotional support through natural language conversations.

## Objective:
Develop a scenario-based report that demonstrates how diverse prompting techniques can be used to optimize MediGuide’s responses in different use cases.

### Define the Scenario and Target Audience
Scenario:  
“MediGuide” is an AI-powered smart health assistant designed to support elderly patients in managing chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The assistant provides personalized health advice, medication reminders, daily wellness tips, and emotional support through natural language conversations. It aims to improve patients’ adherence to treatment plans and enhance their overall wellbeing.

Target Audience:   
Elderly patients suffering from chronic illnesses, their caregivers, and healthcare providers who seek better patient engagement and health management tools.

### Main Objectives:

1.Improve medication adherence by 25%.  
2.Provide personalized health tips based on patient data.  
3.Deliver empathetic emotional support to reduce patient anxiety.  
4.Enable real-time monitoring and alerts for critical health changes.  
5.Facilitate better communication between patients and healthcare providers.

### Different Prompt Patterns

1.Idea Generation Prompt  
PROMPT:“Suggest five innovative features ‘MediGuide’ could offer to improve elderly patients’ management of chronic diseases.”	   
RESPONSE: Voice-activated check-ins, diet logging with photo input, real-time vitals tracking, caregiver alert system, and motivational health coaching.These features enhance usability, safety, and daily health engagement for elderly users.  

2.Explanatory	Prompt  
PROMPT:“Explain how ‘MediGuide’ personalizes medication reminders for patients with varying daily routines.”	   
RESPONSE:MediGuide analyzes individual sleep patterns, activity levels, and medical history to time reminders appropriately.It adapts to missed doses, routine changes, and caregiver feedback for higher accuracy.     

3.Refinement Prompt   
PROMPT:“Rewrite this medication reminder to sound more empathetic and encouraging: ‘It’s time to take your medicine.’”	   
RESPONSE :“Hi there! Just a gentle nudge—taking your medicine now will help keep you feeling your best today.”This version adds warmth and motivation to encourage adherence.  

4.Evaluation	Prompt        
“Evaluate the potential impact of ‘MediGuide’ on improving medication adherence and emotional wellbeing in elderly users.”	   
RESPONSE:MediGuide can improve adherence through smart, timely prompts and reduce loneliness with daily supportive interactions.Its empathetic tone and personalized approach build trust and promote mental wellness.

  

### Scenario Testing Prompts

1.Emergency Symptom Report:   
PROMPT : “A patient reports sudden chest pain during a conversation. How should ‘MediGuide’ respond to ensure patient safety?”      
RESPONSE : MediGuide should immediately advise the patient to stop activity, call emergency services, and alert a caregiver or contact.
It must also record the incident and provide calm, supportive communication during the wait.    

2.Missed Medication Reminder:   
PROMPT : “The patient missed their morning medication. Generate a gentle reminder that encourages adherence without sounding punitive.”    
RESPONSE : “Good morning! Just a quick reminder—don’t worry if you missed your dose, but it’s still a good time to take it now.”
This maintains a supportive tone while promoting responsibility.   

3.Daily Wellness Tip Delivery:  
PROMPT : “Simulate a daily tip about managing blood sugar levels that is clear and easy for elderly patients to understand.”   
 RESPONSE : “Remember to eat small meals regularly and include fiber-rich foods like oats and veggies—they help keep your sugar steady.”
Simple language and a positive tone make it practical and easy to follow.  

4.Emotional Support Interaction:  
PROMPT : “The patient expresses feelings of loneliness. How should ‘MediGuide’ provide emotional support in response?”   
 RESPONSE : “I’m here for you. Would you like to hear something uplifting or connect with a friend or support group today?”
This shows empathy while offering options for emotional connection.   

5.Medication Schedule Change:  
PROMPT : “The doctor updates the patient’s medication timing. How should ‘MediGuide’ notify the patient and update reminders?”  
RESPONSE : “Your doctor has updated your medication schedule. I’ve adjusted your reminders accordingly—shall I show you the new times?”
This provides clarity, reassurance, and a prompt for patient confirmation.



### Implementation Plan

1.System Configuration   
“MediGuide” will run on cloud servers with secure access via smartphones or tablets. It will integrate with wearable health devices for real-time data. Natural language processing (NLP) engines will handle conversations, and a backend AI model will personalize advice and reminders based on patient data.

2.Component Selection   
Key components include a robust NLP model (like GPT or BERT), secure cloud infrastructure, APIs for wearable data integration, and a mobile app interface. Privacy and data security features will be essential, following healthcare regulations such as HIPAA.

3.Software Development  
Development will include training AI models on healthcare conversation datasets, coding medication reminder logic, and implementing emotional support modules. The mobile app will provide a user-friendly interface for elderly users with accessibility features.

4.Testing and Validation
Testing will cover functionality (reminders, advice), responsiveness, data privacy, and conversational quality. Simulated patient interactions and real user feedback will validate assistant performance and usability.

### Documentation of Findings for Prompt Techniques

Idea Generation: Generated useful and novel feature ideas, enhancing system innovation.   
Explanatory: Provided clear, easy-to-understand explanations ideal for diverse stakeholders.   
Refinement: Helped improve tone and engagement in patient-facing communications.
